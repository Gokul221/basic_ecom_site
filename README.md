# Learning Redux Toolkit
This is the repository for a basic e-commerce site primarily focused on incorporating some concepts of React Redux Toolkit into the web-app. The code is based on the course 'Learning Redux Toolkit' on LinkedIn Learning. Covers usage of redux reducers, actions, redux store, react hooks like useSelector, useDispatch, also fetching API data using createAsyncThunk and a basic UI using React and SCSS styling.

This app performs operations like - 
1) Adding/removing items into cart and clearing cart using reducer functions from 'slices' of states.
2) Displaying cart products from Redux store.
3) Fetching data from API using async logic with createAsyncThunk() and useEffect() hook in React.
4) Serving /product route which contains data in json file and fetching data asynchronously from it.
